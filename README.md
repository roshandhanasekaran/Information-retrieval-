# Information-retrieval-

This report mainly focuses on the core concepts of information retrieval namely building a search engine and building a document clustering model. For web crawling, scrapy and Nltk library were majorly used to do the crawling and the preprocessing for task one and NumPy, pandas and Sklearn libraries were also utilized in task two. The dataset used for clustering was taken from Kaggle and the website used for crawling was Coventry universityâ€™s SEFA research webpage.
For an interactive search we have also utilized flask framework to build up an UI for the user and styled it with the help of HTML and CSS.
